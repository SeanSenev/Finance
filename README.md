Hi Mike,
basically, I am getting this bigass string of price history for a given ticker symbol.
Of all that data, I just want the float close price. 

{"open":299.9,"high":299.9,"low":299.9,"close":299.9,"volume":1000,"datetime":1588809240000}


This is what I get basically like 100,00 times with a comma as a delimiter. I just want an array
of close prices as the return.
